<p>The diagram above shows us the relationship between the first second and third triad. Starting from the outside in we go from Ultimate Reality, to Objective Reality, to Subjective Reality. Each element consisting of Consciousness, Force, and Form,it is theoretically possible to continue dividing The Prime Fractal into finer and finer expressions of Consciousness,Force, and Form by recursively connecting the three midpoints of every side of every triangle. Like the Ouroboros The Prime Fractal is infinitely nourished by consuming itself.
