<p>Other than being a metaphysical framework PFP provides a set of pragmatic principles and concepts for living a better life
bringing the idea of perptual growth and learning into our everyday lives. As with every other worthy endeavour we need a set
concepts and princples we can apply,and a set of parameters that we can measure objectively to determine if we are successful;</p>

<li>THE ETERNAL SPRING METHOD</li>
<li>Identify your purpose</li>
<li>Identify essential attributes</li>
<li>Identify essential principles</li>
<li>Internalize attributes & apply principles</li>
<li>Observe & Refine</li>
</ul>
<div id="Eternal-Spring-Method">
<p>In phase one we define in the simplest terms possible what our objective is. In defining the objective we need to make sure that we can establish some form of metric so we have an objective and realistic perception of how effective we are in applying the method. In phase two we consider what qualities we need to develop, modify, or acquire within ourselves in order to accomplish our stated purpose. In phase three we look at what is intrinsically true about our relationship to our environment, these truths are identified as principles. We then ask ourselves how we can utilize these principles in accomplishing our purpose. Phase four is concerned with training methodology, what is the most efficient way to develop attributes and internalizes principles that will allow us to spontaneously move forward in accomplishing our goal. In phase five we are in actual pursuit of our goal and while in pursuit we are measuring how efficient and effective we are in our pursuit and if our progress is unsatisfactory we must re-examine and if necessary refine our training methodology or take yet another step back and look at whether or not we have correctly identified the necessary attributes and principles. Also we must consider who we are as individuals all the knowledge in the world is useless if you are too lazy to apply it.</p> 
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>PARAMETERS FOR SUCCESS</li>
<li>Health & Vitality</li>
<li>Personal Effectiveness</li>
<li>Quality Relationships</li>
</ul>
<p>When applying a method for a specific result is is important to have parameters for measurement in order to determine if the method being applied is effective. In using PFP as a method of personal development the qualities listed above fumction as parameters of succesful application of the method. Regardless of age we want to maintain a healthy level of energy and live a passionate joyful life. Secondly we want to manifest a high degreeof personal effectiveness, we want the ability to set logical achiveable goals and sustain the motivation necessary to see those goals through to completion. Lastly we want to have quality relationships , to be a positive influence in the lives of others and seek out those who will have a positive influence on us. </p>
