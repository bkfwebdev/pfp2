Over many years of searching, reading , thinking and growing under the influence of my father (Joseph Feld) 
and his exstensive at home library, my 35+ years of martial arts training (www.vtkfsystem.com) and my own personal research in the realms spiruality and metaphysics;
I have come up with my own method of applied philosophy that I have named "The Prime Fractal Philosophy (PFP)". 
PFP is not anyhthing new, it is simply a cohesive framework combining the ideas and concepts from various schools of 
thought that have resonated with me into a logical and useful pacakage. It is my opinion that the purpose of creation is to learn
,to grow,and to share. PFP provides a framework for understanding the microcosm, the macrocosm, where we came from,where we are, and where we are going.
The you tube clip to the left discusses how mythology is a historical record of the path to discovering identity,meaning ,and purpose on a personal level.
Joseph Campbell describes this as the monomyth or "The Hero's Journey".Each of us is "the hero", with the goal of the hero being to determine, discover and express
his or her ultimate potential. PFP provides the context for that journey,I created this website to share PFP with you, I hope you will also find it useful. -Sifu Bryant K. Feld
