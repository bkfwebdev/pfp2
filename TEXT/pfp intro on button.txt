The idea at the foundation of this metaphysical world view is everything in creation is the result of the recursive application of a fractal pattern. 
The elements of that fractal being Consciousness, Force, and Form. All the complexity of the universe is rooted in the repeated expression of this very simple pattern.
Fueled by consciousness simple forces and forms interact and combine to form progessively more complex forces and forms. 
For the purpose of clarification we will need to re-define the terms force, form , and consciousness. For those definitions please click the button labeled First-Triad,
but before you do that please watch the wonderful video to the left on fractals
