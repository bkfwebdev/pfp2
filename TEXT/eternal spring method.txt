What is Ving Tsun; in short it is a method of knowledge acquisition and skill development. This is a method that can be applied to any pursuit. There are 5 key phases to this method and they are identified as follows;


1.       Define your purpose

2.       Identify Attributes

3.       Identify Principles

4.       Develop Attributes and internalize principles

5.       Apply and Refine

In phase one we define in the simplest terms possible what our objective is. In defining the objective we need to make sure that we can establish some form of metric so we have an objective and realistic perception of how effective we are in applying the method. In phase two we consider what qualities we need to develop, modify, or acquire within ourselves in order to accomplish our stated purpose. In phase three we look at what is intrinsically true about our relationship to our environment, these truths are identified as principles. We then ask ourselves how we can utilize these principles in accomplishing our purpose. Phase four is concerned with training methodology, what is the most efficient way to develop attributes and internalizes principles that will allow us to spontaneously move forward in accomplishing our goal. In phase five we are in actual pursuit of our goal and while in pursuit we are measuring how efficient and effective we are in our pursuit and if our progress is unsatisfactory we must re-examine and if necessary refine our training methodology or take yet another step back and look at whether or not we have correctly identified the necessary attributes and principles. Also we must consider who we are as individuals all the knowledge in the world is useless if you are too lazy to apply it, I’ll save that discussion for another post.
