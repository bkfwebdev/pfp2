The First-Triad is the Prime Fractal,it is the highest level of reality and can olny be exeperienced directly via meditation. 
It is the realm of infinite possiblity,as all things are possible, based on choice we choose what is probable, and then eventually what is actual.
As statted in the Kybalion the true nature of reality is MENTAL, that is what is represented by the First-Triad, is is the root level of reality, 
what we experience in our normaleverday lives consist of the trunk and branches. This is in no way to suggest that we can somehow impose our will on objective reality,
i.e. forcing something to happen by merely wishing it to happen.However through training and application of the practical aspects of PFP 
we can definitely increase our levels of personal efectiveness. It is my oppinion that the Morphic Field Theory proposed by Rupert Sheldrake 
gives us some insight into the nature of the First-Triad level of reality. The First Triad consist of Consciousness,Force, and Form. Consciousness is a mirror
reflecting back on itself and through that reflection it refines itself. What rises out of this reflective process are force and form. Forces being dynamic 
expressions of consciousness and forms being static expressions of consciouness.Even these descriptions are not satisfactory as forms can be dynamic 
and forces can be static. Overall what is most imporatant to remember that we are speaking of one thing , THE ONE THING, and how this thing in reflecting on itself
expresses itself in infifnite ways. Consciousness is what give force to form,and form to force,creating an infifnite interacting fractal tapestry of force and forms.
