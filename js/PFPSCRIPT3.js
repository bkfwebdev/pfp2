    textContent: "The idea at the foundation of this metaphysical world view is everything in creation is the result of the recursive application of a fractal pattern. The elements of that fractal being Consciousness, Force, and Form. All the complexity of the universe is rooted in the repeated expression of this very simple pattern. Fueled by consciousness simple forces and forms interact and combine to form progessively more complex forces and forms. For the purpose of clarification we will need to re-define the terms force, form , and consciousness. For those definitions please click the button labeled First-Triad,but before you do that please watch the wonderful video to the right on fractals",

    textContent: "The First-Triad is The Prime Fractal,it is the highest level of reality and can only be experienced directly via meditation. It is the realm of infinite possiblity,as all things are possible, based on choice we choose what is probable, and then eventually what is actual. As stated in The Kybalion the true nature of reality is MENTAL, that is what is represented by the First-Triad, it is the root level of reality, what we experience in our normal everday lives consist of the trunk and branches. This is in no way to suggest that we can somehow impose our will on objective reality,i.e. forcing something to happen by merely wishing it to happen. However through training and application of the practical aspects of PFP we can definitely increase our levels of personal effectiveness. It is my opinion that the Morphic Field Theory proposed by Rupert Sheldrake gives us some insight into the nature of the First-Triad level of reality. The First Triad consist of Consciousness,Force, and Form. Consciousness is a mirror reflecting back on itself and through that reflection it refines itself. What rises out of this reflective process are force and form. Forces being dynamic expressions of consciousness and forms being static expressions of consciousness. Even these descriptions are not satisfactory as forms can be dynamic and forces can be static. Overall what is most imporatant to remember is that we are speaking of one thing , THE ONE THING, and how this thing in reflecting on itself expresses itself in infinite ways. Consciousness is what gives force to form,and form to force,creating an infinite interacting fractal tapestry of forces and forms.",

    textContent: "Consciousness is the root of reality, eternal being reflecting on eternal being. It is all that ever was, all that is, and all that shall be.It is beyond our ability to comprehend fully in any sort of intellectual capacity. However, as spiritual sages have expressed through the ages, it is possible to inwardly know the nature of reality through meditation. Through meditation we have the opportunity to experience ourselves as simply being, which is the nature of consciousness. As the Kybalion states as it is above,so it is below. At our core we are invidualized units of consciousness,the self experiencing the SELF. In addittion the reflective and fractal qualities of consciousness generate net works of indvidiaulized units of consciousness with it's associated forces/forms each connected to every other individualized unit of consciousness. By examing the world we learn about ourselves,by examining ourselves we learn about the nature of the universe. It would make sense that in analyzing the universe mathematically we would find the same type of mathematics that describes a network of interconnected nodes. ",

At the first triad level we see the 'why' of Force, at the second triad level we see the 'How' of force. At the the third triad level we experience the result of these upper level forces and forms and grow as we seek to understand our experience of them.",

    buttonLabel: "Form",
    textContent: "Form is the static quality of consciousness, form is information, structural, procedural,logical, Form tells force how to behave,both force and form are active qualities of consciousness. We see aspects of form in solid objects and their behavior as described by newtonian physics, both the objects and the the laws that govern them are Forms. The active and dynamic qualities of the objects as they follow these laws is Force. Modern science deals primarily with Form, the behavior of physical objects at the Second Triad level. The Second Triad is the realm of 'How' the first triad is the realm of 'Why'. There was a time in human history when spirituality and the physical sciences where two parts of one holistic discipline that we will call esoteric science. There are a variety of reasons why esoteric science split into two lesser forms of study but we will save that discussion for another time.",

    buttonLabel: "Second-Triad",
    textContent: "The second Triad is Time Space and Energy,it is the canvas on  which consciousness expresses itself, through it's various forces and forms. Currently the dominant perspective is that through a set of arbitrary physical laws established at the beginning of time everything that we see today evolved through a mechanical deterministic process that eventually produced living breathing things with various levels of consciousness. In this instance we are speaking of consciousness in the normal everyday use of the word. The ability to be self aware and to interact dynamically with your environment in a manner that serves your own best interest. PFP says just the opposite, by defining consciousnessas as the substrate of reality, we are saying that time space and energy arise from consciousness. This is not to imply that the activity of the individual human mind or the larger collective mind of thinking beings somehow wills reality into existence. Again, consciousnessis being defined simply as what gives form to force and force to form,both of which are simply active qualities of ONE.",

    textContent: "Time and space as demonstated by Einstein,are interwoven and insperable. Time is the 4th dimension,our experience of space-time consist of passing slices of physical states in the three dimensional world as the laws of physics play out. What prevents this from being a purely deterministic process is choice. All things are possible,our choices determine what is probable. By changing who we are being we can change our circumstances.",

    textContent: "Space is not simply an empty void, space is a practically infinite field of no-thing-ness, meaning that it is not any one thing until it is directed by consciousness (1st triad) to become a specific thing. It is a field of infinite potentiality, the canvas on which the prime fractal expresses itself. Again it is important to point out that I am not implying that an individual human consciousness simply through force of will can have an immediate and direct effect on objective reality.",

Energy is the interplay between forces and forms at the sceond triad level. This interplay is described by the physical sciences. The revelation that matter and energy are interchangeable points back to the relationship between force and form at the first triad level being simply two aspects of one thing. ",

The strenthing of any one aspect strengthens all three albeit to a lesser degree. Your world view, your emotional and psycological health affect your physical well being and vice versa. It is important to become aware of your SELF and take the necessary steps to develop it's three aspects to their highest degree. Life itself will force us to develop to a certain degree, however we can achive much more by taking an active role in our development.",

Wether or not the idividual unit of consciousness maintains it's 'identity' is a matter it's level of qualitative development. The Self is indeed an illusion as the nature of reality is essentially ONE. It is a nescessary illusion for the purposes of development, the ability to see through the illusion indictaes a certain level of development removing the necessity of the illusion.",

This should not be a suprise as it follows logically from our previous statement that ALL is essentially ONE. The experience of life causes qualitative changes in spirit, this qualitative refinement is reabsorbed into first triad level consciousness. Mind-Body-Spirit is the microcosm of Consciosuness-Force-Form, although we cannot perform yoda-esque feats of telekinesis we can excercise an amazing degree of control over our minds and bodies by strenthening the spirit. I doubt we have reached the limits of the capabilities of a fully integrated human being whom has mastered mind,body,and spirit.",
