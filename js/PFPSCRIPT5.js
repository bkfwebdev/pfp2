    textContent: "The idea at the foundation of this metaphysical world view is everything in creation is the result of the recursive application of a fractal pattern. The elements of that fractal being Consciousness, Force, and Form. All the complexity of the universe is rooted in the repeated expression of this very simple pattern. Fueled by consciousness simple forces and forms interact and combine to form progressively more complex forces and forms. For the purpose of clarification we will need to re-define the terms force, form , and consciousness. For those definitions please click the button labeled First-Triad,but before you do that please watch the wonderful video to the right on fractals",

    textContent: "The First-Triad is The Prime Fractal,it is the highest level of reality and can only be experienced directly via meditation. It is the realm of infinite possibility,as all things are possible, based on choice we choose what is probable, and then eventually what is actual. As stated in The Kybalion the true nature of reality is MENTAL, that is what is represented by the First-Triad, it is the root level of reality, what we experience in our normal everday lives consist of the trunk and branches. This is in no way to suggest that we can somehow impose our will on objective reality,i.e. forcing something to happen by merely wishing it to happen. However through training and application of the practical aspects of PFP we can definitely increase our levels of personal effectiveness. It is my opinion that the Morphic Field Theory proposed by Rupert Sheldrake gives us some insight into the nature of the First-Triad level of reality. The First Triad consist of Consciousness,Force, and Form. Consciousness is a mirror reflecting back on itself and through that reflection it refines itself. What rises out of this reflective process are force and form. Forces being dynamic expressions of consciousness and forms being static expressions of consciousness. Even these descriptions are not satisfactory as forms can be dynamic and forces can be static. Overall what is most important to remember is that we are speaking of one thing , THE ONE THING, and how this thing in reflecting on itself expresses itself in infinite ways. Consciousness is what gives force to form,and form to force,creating an infinite interacting fractal tapestry of forces and forms.",

    textContent: "Consciousness is the root of reality, eternal being reflecting on eternal being. It is all that ever was, all that is, and all that shall be.It is beyond our ability to comprehend fully in any sort of intellectual capacity. However, as spiritual sages have expressed through the ages, it is possible to inwardly know the nature of reality through meditation. Through meditation we have the opportunity to experience ourselves as simply being, which is the nature of consciousness. As the Kybalion states as it is above,so it is below. At our core we are individualized units of consciousness,the self experiencing the SELF. In addition the reflective and fractal qualities of consciousness generate net works of individualized units of consciousness with it's associated forces/forms each connected to every other individualized unit of consciousness. By examining the world we learn about ourselves,by examining ourselves we learn about the nature of the universe. It would make sense that in analyzing the universe mathematically we would find the same type of mathematics that describes a network of interconnected nodes. ",

    textContent: "Force is the animating active quality of consciousness,force can be simple or complex,forces can exist as laws e.g.the laws of physics.Again you have to remember we are not using the term in it's every day sense although it is inclusive of the everday use of the term. At the first triad level we see the 'why' of Force, at the second triad level we see the 'How' of force. At the the third triad level we experience the result of these upper level forces and forms and grow as we seek to understand our experience of them.",

    buttonLabel: "Form",
    textContent: "Form is the static quality of consciousness, form is information, structural, procedural,logical, Form tells force how to behave,both force and form are active qualities of consciousness. We see aspects of form in solid objects and their behavior as described by Newtonian physics, both the objects and the the laws that govern them are Forms. The active and dynamic qualities of the objects as they follow these laws is Force. Modern science deals primarily with Form, the behavior of physical objects at the Second Triad level. The Second Triad is the realm of 'How' the first triad is the realm of 'Why'. There was a time in human history when spirituality and the physical sciences where two parts of one holistic discipline that we will call esoteric science. There are a variety of reasons why esoteric science split into two lesser forms of study but we will save that discussion for another time.",

    buttonLabel: "Second-Triad",
    textContent: "The second Triad is Time Space and Energy,it is the canvas on  which consciousness expresses itself, through it's various forces and forms. Currently the dominant perspective is that through a set of arbitrary physical laws established at the beginning of time everything that we see today evolved through a mechanical deterministic process that eventually produced living breathing things with various levels of consciousness. In this instance we are speaking of consciousness in the normal everyday use of the word. The ability to be self aware and to interact dynamically with your environment in a manner that serves your own best interest. PFP says just the opposite, by defining consciousness as as the substrate of reality, we are saying that time space and energy arise from consciousness. This is not to imply that the activity of the individual human mind or the larger collective mind of thinking beings somehow wills reality into existence. Again, consciousness is being defined simply as what gives form to force and force to form,both of which are simply active qualities of ONE.",

Time is the 4th dimension,our experience of space-time consist of passing slices of physical states in the three dimensional world as the laws of physics play out. What prevents this from being a purely deterministic process is choice. All things are possible,our choices determine what is probable. By changing who we are being we can change our circumstances.",

    textContent: "Space is not simply an empty void, space is a practically infinite field of no-thing-ness, meaning that it is not any one thing until it is directed by consciousness (1st triad) to become a specific thing. It is a field of infinite potentiality, the canvas on which the prime fractal expresses itself. Again it is important to point out that I am not implying that an individual human consciousness simply through force of will can have an immediate and direct effect on objective reality.",

Energy is the interplay between forces and forms at the sceond triad level. This interplay is described by the physical sciences. The revelation that matter and energy are interchangeable points back to the relationship between force and form at the first triad level being simply two aspects of one thing. ",

The strengthening of any one aspect strengthens all three albeit to a lesser degree. Your world view, your emotional and psychological health affect your physical well being and vice versa. It is important to become aware of your SELF and take the necessary steps to develop it's three aspects to their highest degree. Life itself will force us to develop to a certain degree, however we can achive much more by taking an active role in our development.",

Whether or not the individual unit of consciousness maintains it's 'identity' is a matter it's level of qualitative development. The Self is indeed an illusion as the nature of reality is essentially ONE. It is a necessary illusion for the purposes of development, the ability to see through the illusion indicates a certain level of development removing the necessity of the illusion.",

This should not be a surprise as it follows logically from our previous statement that ALL is essentially ONE. The experience of life causes qualitative changes in spirit, this qualitative refinement is reabsorbed into first triad level consciousness. Mind-Body-Spirit is the microcosm of Consciousness-Force-Form, although we cannot perform yoda-esque feats of telekinesis we can exercise an amazing degree of control over our minds and bodies by strengthening the spirit. I doubt we have reached the limits of the capabilities of a fully integrated human being whom has mastered mind,body,and spirit.",

    buttonLabel: "Conclusion",
    textContent: "In summary the prime fractal philosophy is a form of monism. The definition of monism is a theory or doctrine that denies the existence of a distinction or duality, such as that between matter and mind, or God and the world.It contains elements of theses two sub categories of monism - Neutral Monism: This dual-aspect theory maintains that existence consists of one kind of primal substance (hence monism), which in itself is neither mental nor physical, but is capable of mental and physical aspects or attributes. Thus, there is some other, neutral substance (variously labelled as Substance, Nature or God), and that both matter and mind are properties of this other unknown substance. Such a position was adopted by Baruch Spinoza and also by Bertrand Russell for a time.Reflexive Monism: This is a dual-aspect theory (in the tradition of Spinoza) which argues that the one basic stuff of which the universe iscomposed has the potential to manifest both physically and as conscious experience (such as human beings) which can then have a view of both the rest of the universe and themselves (hence 'reflexive').It is a contemporary take on a concept which has been present in human thought for millennia, such as in later Vedic writings like the 'Upanishads' and some beliefs from ancient Egypt.",
